The geographic area that I am examining is Seattle since I have some familiarity with it. 

the available zoom level of each tile set is 10 to 13.

the first tile set just has a few color changes to the city, the land and water, the road network, and the place labels. 
the second tile show the location of schools in seattle. 
the third is a combination of the first two  tiles.
the forth has a color scheme of the university of washington, the best school in seattle and all of washington state.
